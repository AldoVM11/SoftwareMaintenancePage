# Introduction 

## Why GitHub?
As we have learned over the course of the class, at its core, GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system. Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, keeping track of changes made to the codebase over time. With Git, developers can create branches to work on different features or bug fixes independently and later merge those changes back into the main codebase.
GitHub extends the functionality of Git by providing a user-friendly interface and a range of collaboration tools.

Here are some key features of GitHub:

- Issue Tracking: GitHub includes an issue tracking system where you can create, assign, and track issues or bugs in your project. It helps you keep track of tasks, prioritize work, and facilitate communication among team members.

- Pull Requests: Pull requests allow developers to propose changes to a repository. They provide a way to submit code changes, request feedback, and discuss improvements. Pull requests are commonly used for code review before merging changes into the main project.

- Collaboration and Social Features: GitHub enables developers to collaborate on projects with features like commenting, mentioning other users, and emoji reactions. You can have discussions, share ideas, and provide feedback directly on specific lines of code.

- Code Review: GitHub provides tools for code review, making it easy for developers to review each other's code, suggest changes, and discuss improvements. Code review helps improve code quality, catch errors, and ensure adherence to best practices.

- Integrations and Automation: GitHub offers integrations with various development tools and services, such as continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) systems, code analysis tools, testing frameworks, and project management platforms. These integrations allow you to automate parts of your development workflow and streamline processes.


## Why ClickUp?
ClickUp is a versatile project management and collaboration platform designed to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and facilitate effective communication within teams. It provides a wide range of features and tools to help individuals and organizations manage tasks, projects, and processes efficiently.
- Structure and organization: ClickUp offers a variety of features to organize and structure your software projects. You can create task lists, set priorities, create Kanban boards, set up custom workflows, and use different views to visualize your project in different ways. This helps you maintain order and clarity in your software development activities.

- Time and Productivity Tracking: ClickUp allows you to track time spent on tasks and projects, which can be useful for estimating and monitoring resources used. In addition, it provides reports and productivity metrics that allow you to assess team performance and make adjustments as needed.

- Integrations and Automations: ClickUp offers numerous integrations with other popular tools and services, such as Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, and more. This allows you to sync and centralize information in one place, making it easy to communicate and share files with your team.

## Hernández Correa Omar Francisco
GitHub has always been a platform of choice for these types of projects, and just for software engineering in general. It's quite the powerful tool since it exceeds on It excels in managing code repositories, facilitating collaboration among developers, and providing features like version control, code review, issue tracking, and documentation. Our primary deal with it, of course, is the fact that we can work in a team from a much easier way. That is why this tool is so hando, and now, combining it with ClickUp, which hold just as many features, but even broader than ever, we can end up creating something special.
